<h1>INTRODUCTION TO HTML5</h1>
HTML5 is the next major revision of the HTML standard superseding HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0,
and XHTML 1.1. HTML5 is a standard for structuring and presenting content on the World
Wide Web.<br/>
HTML5 is a cooperation between the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web
Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).<br/>
The new standard incorporates features like video playback and drag-and-drop that have
been previously dependent on third-party browser plug-ins such as Adobe Flash, Microsoft
Silverlight, and Google Gears.<br/>
<b>Browser Support</b><br/>
The latest versions of Apple Safari, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera all support
many HTML5 features and Internet Explorer 9.0 will also have support for some HTML5
functionality.<br/>
The mobile web browsers that come pre-installed on iPhones, iPads, and Android phones all
have excellent support for HTML5.<br/>
<b>New Features<br/></b>
HTML5 introduces a number of new elements and attributes that can help you in building
modern websites. Here is a set of some of the most prominent features introduced in HTML5.<br/>
<b>New Semantic Elements:</b><br/> These are like "<(header)>, <(footer)>, and <(section)>."<br/>
<b>Forms 2.0:</b> Improvements to HTML web forms where new attributes have been
introduced for "<(input)>" tag.<br/>
<b> Persistent Local Storage:</b> To achieve without resorting to third-party plugins.<br/>
<b>WebSocket :</b> A next-generation bidirectional communication technology for web
applications.<br/>
<b>Server-Sent Events:</b> HTML5 introduces events which flow from web server to the
web browsers and they are called Server-Sent Events (SSE).<br/>
<b> Canvas:</b>This supports a two-dimensional drawing surface that you can program with
JavaScript.<br/>
<b>Audio & Video: </b>You can embed audio or video on your webpages without resorting
to third-party plugins.<br/>
